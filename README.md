#  AI Content Payment & Ownership Tracker

## LIVE DEMO:  https://ai-content-trracker.vercel.app/

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a practical workflow where:

- Users request AI content generation through X402 orchestration
- Payments are processed via GMPayer integration
- Content ownership is tracked using ERC-8004 principles

## Features

- Simple web interface for content requests
- Mock payment processing with GMPayer
- Ownership tracking and verification
- Content generation simulation
- Basic user dashboard

##  Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-content-marketplace.git
cd ai-content-marketplace
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Architecture

- `src/orchestrator/` - X402-style orchestration logic
- `src/payment/` - GMPayer integration
- `src/ownership/` - ERC-8004 ownership tracking
- `src/web/` - Simple web interface
- `src/ai/` - Mock AI content generation

## Use Case

A content creator wants to:

1. Pay for AI-generated artwork
2. Receive verifiable ownership of the output
3. Track their content library
4. Potentially resell or license their AI-generated content
